#              TASK: -> ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL(RBAC)-UI


<h3> Admin Dashboard for User, Role, and Permission Management<br></h3>

<h6>This project is an admin dashboard designed for managing users, roles, and permissions efficiently.
It implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features, providing an intuitive interface for administrators to assign roles, define permissions, and manage users securely.</h6>

<h3> Thanking VRV security for giving me this opportunity to make this assignment in a given time frame. </h3>

<H3> NOW, Let's want to discuss the approach </H3>

<h4>1. Understand the Requirements</h4>
User Management: Admins can add, edit, delete users, and give them roles (like Admin or User).<br>
Role Management: Admins create roles (like Admin, Editor) and assign them to users.<br>
Permissions: Each role gets permissions (like "Read," "Write," "Delete") that define what the user can do.<br>
Connections: Users → Roles → Permissions. Roles decide what users can do.
<h4>2. Design the Interface</h4>
Make Separate Pages for managing users, roles, and permissions.
Add simple forms and buttons for easy actions like adding and editing.
<h4>3. Setup Fake Backend (Mock APIs)</h4>
Use mock APIs to test adding and updating users and roles without a real database.
These APIs help simulate real data actions like adding a user or changing a role.
<h4>4. Build the User Interface (Frontend)</h4>
Use React.js to build interactive pages.
Show data in tables, and let admins add/edit details with forms and buttons.
<h4>5. Link Everything Together</h4>
For example, when adding a user, the page calls the mock API to add the user, then updates the list of users automatically.
<h4>6. Style the Page</h4>
Use CSS to make the app look nice and easy to use, with readable text and buttons.
<h4>7. Test the App</h4>
Test everything: adding users, editing roles, and assigning permissions.
Make sure everything works, and if there are errors (like missing data), handle them well.

<h3><i>I used vite and react.js to create this projects so command for create the project is npm create vite@latest 
and for run the project it would be npm run dev as dev is dependencies in pavkage.json whose meaning is vite to run the project so the screenshot is </i></h3>
